## 🚀 Overview & Features

**Community Bridge** is a comprehensive compatibility layer that acts as a universal wrapper around all major systems used across FiveM frameworks. Whether you're building with QB-Core, ESX, QBox, or any other framework, this bridge ensures your scripts work seamlessly across all environments.

Instead of writing separate code for each framework's inventory, dispatch, targeting, or notification system, you write once and it works everywhere.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

- 🌐 **Universal Compatibility** - One bridge, all frameworks
- 📚 **Beginner Friendly** - Clean, documented, and easy to understand
- 🚀 **Future Proof** - Built to adapt and grow with the community

### 🔐 **Framework Support**
- **QB-Core** - Full compatibility
- **QBox** - Native support
- **ESX** - Complete integration
- **Custom Frameworks** - Extensible design

Below are the core system integrations and advanced tools available:
